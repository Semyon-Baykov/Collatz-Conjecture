# Collatz-Conjecture
Unsolved problem in mathematics: Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values? The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.

# Using a simply python program to see the conjecture
This very simple code could be used to input any integer and see how many iterations it takes to get the integer to 1. Output is printed in the console, but I will later add some stuff like graphs or other graphics.
